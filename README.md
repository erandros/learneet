## What is this?

learneet is a collaborative editor of a scientific explanations tree (wut?). In other words, a site with academic articles.

The objective of learneet is to soften the learning curve of scientific concepts.
It will be based on two principles.
1. Each article should try to explain **aspects** of ideas, or **atomic** ideas. That means that articles will probably be short (but it's not mandatory).
2. Each article should *__depend__* on a list of more elemental articles. We define that an article `a` depends on a list of articles (for example: `b`, `c` and `d`) when in order to understand article `a`, you have to first understand the articles of that list.

An example of this would be:  
* To understand fractions, you have to understand divisions first.
* To understand divisions, you might have to have to understand multiplications.
* To understand multiplications, you have to understand additions.

And so on, so that, in theory, the dependency tree would take you to the most elemental articles about science. That example is live on the site.
